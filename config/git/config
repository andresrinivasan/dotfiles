# Enforce SSH, most of the time

## For Homebrew, I want to use HTTPS so I can automate updates and still use an SSH key agent for everything else.
## Both lines are needed as the rewrite rules seem to execute on the re-written URL. Without the second line the rules
## would fall through and SSH would get used. Note from the git config docs, longest match wins. Additional rules are
## needed for each tap that is not part of the Homebrew repo
